Special thanks to Kaggle user [jessicali9530](https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530) for uploading the [CelebFaces dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset) which will be downloaded with the IPython Notebook mentioned below. This saves a lot of time when downloading the images.

## How to download this dataset?
* Create a Kaggle account.
* Generate an API key.
* Run the `download_dataset.ipynb` notebook.
* Install the `opendatasets` package like requested (should already be installed on the included environment).
* Fill in the API attributes the notebook asks for when executing the cells.
* At the end you should have a folder called `celeba-dataset/` which should contain a folder with 200k images of faces and a CSV file called `list_attr_celeba.csv` .
